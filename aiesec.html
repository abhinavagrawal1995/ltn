							AIESEC is an international non-governmental not for profit organization that provides young people with cross-cultural global internship and volunteer opportunities and leadership development experiences on campus.
                            <br>
                            With a focus to empower young people so they can make a positive impact on society. AIESEC was originally a French acronym for Association internationale des étudiants en sciences économiques et commerciales (English: International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences). However, the full name is no longer in use. Members come from a variety of college majors, not necessarily from an area related to economic or commercial sciences.

								<h3>History</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The idea behind AIESEC started in the 1938, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students were carrying out internships in other countries, but mostly on their own initiative, and it all came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II
							</p>
							<p>
								In 1944, though, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In Stockholm, Bertil Hedberg, an official at the Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (ofCzechoslovakia), Jean Choplin (of France) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium) founded AIESE. This was the predecessor of AIESEC which was officially founded in 1948.
