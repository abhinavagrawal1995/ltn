										Why Light the Night?</p>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/e.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Imagine the sight of a vast night sky studded with thousands of sky lanterns! Imagine thousands of people from different cultures gathered in one place to witness that. Imagine the immense sense of togetherness, the enthusiasm, energy and tranquility of such a night! AIESEC in Manipal University has taken an initiative to organize an amazing event called 'Light the Night' for all of us to experience exactly that! </p>

										<h3>The Story Behind.</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
							Sky lanterns came into existence when Chinese troops started using them to send signals to one another at the time of war. Then commoners began to employ the use of sky lanterns in everyday activities, using them as a means of sending wishes and prayers up into the sky towards the heavens. Outside of historical value, sky lanterns are also thought to hold good luck as well! It was thought that the longer the sky lantern floated in the air, the better luck they would have, and that the lanterns floating in the air would bring them luck and ease their troubles. 
So, for one night, believe in the magic of good luck, value the mystical belief of the history and Join us to Light a lantern as a simple gesture towards your own dreams and aspirations and release the lantern with a hope in your heart of making those dreams come true! And make memories of a lifetime.

                        <p>
                        Also, some of the fondest memories we gather through the journey of life are our childhood memories! I'm sure, a smile spreads across each one our faces when we think about our childhood. And happiness is the word we associate with it, the most! But every child in the world is not that lucky. In every corner of the world, there are countless children who are subject to a saddening crime â€“ Child Labour. This abomination has deprived children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity. India being the largest example of a nation plagued by it.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        So, this November on Children's day, let's all come together aiming to eradicate this blot on the face of humanity. Let's all take a pledge to stand up against child labour and empower the future of our nation.
Because sometimes all you need is a starry sky, loved ones around you and a beautiful sky lantern to realize the small things in life and create the big change we need!
